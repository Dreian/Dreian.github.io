![Picture of me](/img/pic-andrej.png)

I am a third (final) year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working
under supervision of [Professor Alan Mycroft](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/).
I am a member of the Programming, Logic and Semantics group of the Department of
Computer Science and Technology.
The focus of my PhD are _effect systems_ (formally reasoning about side-effects
in functional programming languages), but my research interests are wider: type
systems, static analysis, program verification, compilers and more.

Prior to doing my PhD, I did four years of the undegraduate and master's
Computer Science Tripos (graduated in June 2018).
I did internships every summer, including at companies such as Microsoft and
Google.

See my CV [here](/cv.pdf).

In high school, I used to be into algorithms and competitive programming (though
I didn't do many contests on Codeforces and similar online judges).
I still have a soft spot for the topic and I have been the Cambridge coach for
[ICPC](https://icpc.global/) since the autumn of 2019.
